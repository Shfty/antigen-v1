TODO: Split IntRangeComponent into PrimitiveComponent<i64> and PrimitiveComponent<Range<i64>>

TODO: Refactor software renderer / string renderer into a single system
      Input data fetching + rendering code is the only major difference
      Need to figure out a good abstraction
      Could move common logic into an impl, have the renderers call it manually

TODO: Re-add list item assemblage support to allow for debug excluding list items, but not their parent lists

TODO: Component data inspector

TODO: Filtering for debug components
      Entities
        If a component is selected, filter out entities that don't have it
        If component data is selected, filter out other entities
        If a system is selected, filter out entities that don't have components that it processes (pending system dependency setup)
      Scene tree
        Use the same rules as entities
      Components
        If an entity is selected, filter out components that don't have a data entry for it
        If component data is selected, filter out other components
        If a system is selected, filter out components that it doesn't process (pending system dependency setup)
      Component data
        If an entity is selected, filter out data from other entities
        If a component is selected, filter out data from other components
        If a system is selected, filter out data from components that system doesn't process (pending system dependency setup)

TODO: Scrolling for lists

TODO: Event synthesis for list hover / click
      Rather than supplying generic hover / click events, list control components should take them as a generic parameter
      This way, arbitrary events can be pushed into the queue for handling by other systems - comparable to Godot's signal/slot setup
      Each list should be able to push multiple events in response to hover / click

TODO: Profiler window
      Will need a custom shader input struct to draw graphs
            Can this be done via generics?
            Or is it better to use generic ShaderInputComponent<T> storage looked up by the shader?
                  Wouldn't work directly for GPU, but could be wrapped by the appropriate renderer
            Could setup shader-specific systems and dataflow for more complex functionality
                  Easy to keep general, can define your own pipeline

TODO: Clipping rects for UI controls
TODO: Refactor list system to only update when hover, selection, list item count or contents have changed

TODO: Register entity fetches and associated logic at System registration time to allow for runtime lookup optimization
